<!-- PSEUDOCODE

* create pop up that gives users instructions on how to play Jeopardy *


1) create a single player mode

2) create categories that align with chosen theme

    . pick a category and its associated point value

Categories 

     . Category needs a few clickable elements beneath them that are worth a variety of points.

- These elements need to be:

     . Clickable
     . Store a value (the points it’s worth)
     . Disappear or disable themselves after they’ve been selected.

Category tasks:
     . Be clickable
     . Store the value of the selected element.
     . Take that value and add it to the player points if the correct answer was selected.
      

3) answer question in alotted time period

    . when category is clicked, 10 second timer begins
    . if question is answered before 10 second timer ends, points are awarded
    . if question is not answered before 10 second timer ends, no points are awarded

- Timer needs to do 3 things 

    . Start.
    . Countdown 
    . Check if the correct answer was chosen, and if not display something.

- Timer task:

    . onClick that listens for when a user clicks a category.
    . startTimer() function to start the countdown.
    . if/else statement you check if an answer was chosen before time runs out.

* create a function that will make each cateogory return a response of correct or incorrect *
* create a variable that calls total score *
* create another function that adds total score *

4) If correct, say "Correct" and award associated points

    . if correct, return point value to total score


5) if incorrect, say "Incorrect" and follow up with correct answer response.

    . if it is incorrect, return correct response answer

6) Game continues until all questions have been answered and/or points recieved.

    . create a function that will know when all questions have been answered

7) If player earns more than 2000, points, they win the game.

    . create a function that knows when total score value reaches 2000 points

8) if player earns less than 2000 points, player loses the game.

    . create a function that will respond with "winner" if user total score is greater than or equal to 2000 points
    . create a function that will respond with "loser" if user total score is under 2000 points -->
